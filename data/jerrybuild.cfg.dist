# Examples:
#   keep_jobs = 0   # Keep an infinite number of jobs
#   keep_jobs = 10  # Keep the last 10 job results
#   keep_jobs = 4d  # Remove job results older than 4 days

# Include jobs from a directory

# Put your jobs in the jobs.d/ directory. The files need to end with '.cfg' and
# should contain a `[job:....]` definition. Take a look at the `EXAMPLE.cfg`
# job.
